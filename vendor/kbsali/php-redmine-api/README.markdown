## Autoload

The first step to use `php-redmine-api` is to download composer:

```bash
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Then create a composer.json file in the root of your project:

```yaml
{
    "require": {
        "kbsali/redmine-api": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

... and install your dependencies using:
```bash
$ php composer.phar install
```

## Basic usage of `php-redmine-api` client

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Redmine\Client('http://redmine.example.com', '1234567890abcdfgh');

$client->api('user')->all();
$client->api('user')->listing();

$client->api('issue')->create(array(
    'project_id'  => 'test',
    'subject'     => 'some subject',
    'description' => 'a long description blablabla',
    'assigned_to' => 'user1',
));
```

see `example.php`
